# 🍽️ Restaurant Review Analytics Dashboard

A **Streamlit-based NLP dashboard** that analyzes restaurant customer reviews to extract **sentiment, aspect-level insights, trends, and actionable business intelligence**. The project is designed to be **academically sound**, **industry-aligned**, and **portfolio-ready**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Restaurants receive thousands of customer reviews across platforms. Manually analyzing them is time-consuming and subjective. This project automates the analysis by applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to:

- Classify customer sentiment (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
- Identify key restaurant aspects (food, service, ambience, price, cleanliness)
- Track sentiment trends over time
- Highlight strengths and areas for improvement
- Provide downloadable, processed insights for decision-makers

The dashboard is built using **Python, NLTK, TextBlob, Plotly, and Streamlit**.

## 📄 Expected Input Format

The dashboard accepts a **CSV file** with the following columns:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Review     | Customer review text |
| Rating     | Numerical rating (e.g., 1–5) |
| Time       | Review timestamp (date or datetime) |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Streamlit** – dashboard & deployment
- **NLTK** – text preprocessing
- **TextBlob** – sentiment analysis
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Plotly** – interactive visualizations
- **Matplotlib & WordCloud** – text visualization

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Sentiment analysis uses **TextBlob**, which:
  - Is fast and interpretable
  - May not fully capture sarcasm or complex context
- This model is intended as a **baseline NLP solution**
- The architecture allows easy upgrades to:
  - Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM)
  - Deep Learning models (BERT, RoBERTa)

---

## 📈 Possible Enhancements

- Replace TextBlob with ML-based sentiment classifier
- Add rating prediction (1–5 stars)
- User authentication & multi-restaurant support
- Deployment on **Streamlit Cloud**
- Integration with Google / Yelp review scraping
